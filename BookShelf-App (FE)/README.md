# Bookshelf Apps

The Bookshelf App is a simple application that allows users to organize their books into two shelves that can be moved, deleted, and includes a search feature.

## Features

1. **Two Book Shelves:** There are two bookshelves, namely "Shelf One" and "Shelf Two." Users can move books between these shelves using drag and drop.

2. **Book Deletion:** Users can delete books by clicking on the delete icon on each book they want to remove.

3. **Book Search:** The search feature allows users to search for books based on their titles.

## Usage

1. **Running the App:**
   - Make sure the files `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css` are in the same folder.
   - Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the application.

2. **Adding a Book:**
   - Click on the "Add Book" button to add a new book to Shelf One.
   - Fill in the book information requested (title, author, publication year, etc.).

3. **Moving Books:**
   - To move a book, simply drag it from one shelf to another.

4. **Deleting Books:**
   - Click the "delete" icon on the book to be removed from the shelf.

5. **Searching for Books:**
   - Utilize the search feature by typing the book title in the search field to find a specific book.

## Technology

- **HTML:** Used for the structure of the interface.
